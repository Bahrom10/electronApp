# File-Xplorer

File-Xplorer is a simple file explorer application built using Electron, Vue 3, and Vite. This project is not for commercial use; it was created for my portfolio and represents my first experience with Electron.

## Description

File-Xplorer allows users to navigate through their file system, view file contents, and edit text files. The application leverages Electron to provide a desktop application experience and Vue 3 for the frontend.

## Features

- Navigate through folders
- View file contents
- Edit and save text files

## Installation

Before you start, completing this steps, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
   ```
   https://nodejs.org/en/download
   ```
You will need npm only for this project.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone "https://github.com/Bahrom10/electronApp.git"
   ```
2. Install dependecies:
    ```
    npm i
    ```
3. Run this command:
    ```
    npm run make
    ```
4. Package the app:
   ```
   npm run package
   ```

Now your app is ready, you can get it from "out" directory. I would have published windows app here, but unfortunately, i'm not able to do that because of the size of the app. 

<strong>THIS APP WEIGHTS A LOT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY, DON'T INSTALL IT.</strong>
